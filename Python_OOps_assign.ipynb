        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable, self-contained units called objects, which are instances of classes, and uses principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP also exists in other programming languages and is often described to center around the four pillars, or four tenants of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Encapsulation allows you to bundle data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) within a class to create a cohesive unit. By defining methods to control access to attributes and its modification, encapsulation helps maintain data integrity and promotes modular, secure code.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes, allowing a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  Abstraction focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential functionality of an object. By enforcing a consistent interface, abstraction simplifies interactions with objects, allowing developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "->  Polymorphism allows you to treat objects of different types as instances of the same base type, as long as they implement a common interface or behavior. Python’s duck typing make it especially suited for polymorphism, as it allows you to access attributes and methods on objects without needing to worry about their actual class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans - In Python, dunder methods are methods that allow instances of a class to interact with the built-in functions and operators of the language. The word “dunder” comes from “double underscore”, because the names of dunder methods start and end with two underscores, for example __str__ or __add__. Typically, dunder methods are not invoked directly by the programmer, making it look like they are called by magic. That is why dunder methods are also referred to as “magic methods” sometimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods are not called magically, though. They are just called implicitly by the language, at specific times that are well-defined, and that depend on the dunder method in question."

        "Why it's useful:\n",

        "OOP allows for code reusability through inheritance, where classes can inherit properties and methods from parent classes.\n",
